# Total-Cost-of-Loan
A jupyter notebook I made to get a better idea of the total cost of loans. It calculates the total cost of the loan as well as the montly cost based on the duration and intrest rate. It also has the ability to calculate how much quicker one can pay of the loan based on an avrage extra payment per month.
