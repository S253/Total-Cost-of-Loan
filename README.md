# Total-Cost-of-Loan
A jupyter notebook I made to get a better idea of the total cost of loans. It calculates the total cost of the loan as well as the montly cost based on the duration and intrest rate. 
It also has the ability to calculate how much quicker one can pay of the loan based on an avrage extra payment per month.

Please take the results with a grain of salt. I won't take any resposibility for your financial decisions. Consult your bank or financial advidsor before trusting this simple notebook.


Any assistance in helping me make this better is appreciated. I am condidering doing some type of application or website in the future.
